  <!--Directive examples-->
  <!--*ngIf
        Actually removes element from the dom as opposed to hiding it.-->
  <!--*ngFor
        NgFor has some variables that are part of id (even, odd, last, index). There are more
        if you look at the common.d.ts file-->
  <!--Also an ngClass example. You can use logic/pass variables to determine what class you want to apply-->
  <tr
    [ngClass]="e ? 'even' : 'odd'"
    *ngFor="let room of rooms; let e = even; let o = odd; let l = last; let i = index; let c = count; let f = first;">
    <td>{{i}}</td>
    <!--you can put multiple pipes in a ternary operation like so-->
    <td>{{e ? ("Even" | uppercase) : ("Odd" | uppercase) }} {{f ? "Is first" : ""}}</td>
    <td>{{room.roomNumber}}</td>
    <td>{{room.roomType}}</td>
    <td>{{room.price | currency : 'USD'}}</td>
    <td>{{room.amenities}}</td>
    <!--This td element has an example of a pipe-->
    <!--Pipes are used for data transformation. They dont' changge the actual object though
        Angular has built-in pipes but you can make your own too.
        some Built in pipes (there are more):
        DatePipe
        UpperCasePipe
        LowerCasePipe
        CurrencyPipe
        DecimalPipe
        PercentPipe
        JsonPipe -- shows object as json object. Useful for debuggin
        SlicePipe -- slices array into first index and last index in the frontend {{data | slice :first(inclusive):last(exclusive)}}.
                      remember that it's a pipe. So it won't change the data, just how it's represented in the frontend.
        AsyncPipe
        NumberPipe
        Synax is {{ data | pipe : 'options (and/or params, i think)'}} like below
    -->
    <td>{{room.checkInTime | date : 'short'}}</td>
    <!--number pipe. Options are there to format the number further-->
    <td>{{room.rating | number : '1.0-0'}}</td>
    <td>{{l ? "Yes" : "No"}}</td>
    <td *ngIf="l; else blanks">{{c}} / Last &lt;td&gt; </td>
    <ng-template #blanks>&nbsp;</ng-template>
    <td>
      <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="selectRoom(room)">
        Select Room
      </button>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <!--Why don't some directives don't use `*`? Generally, that's the character that differentiates attribute
      directives from structural directives.
      Structural Directives use *
      Attribute Directives don't use *
      Example:
      *ngIf,*ngFor,*ngSwitchCase are structural Directives
      ngClass, ngStyle, ngSwitch are attribute directives

      Structural directives can modify the DOM (adds/modifies/deletes elements, like adding/removing table rows).
      Meanwhile attribute directives can also modify the dom, but CAN'T add/remove elements (hide maybe, but not removing)
      from the dom.

      The star doesn't necessarily make a structural directive for. It's there mainly to be used as
      'structural directive shorthand' (see image: [projectroot]/referenceImages/structuralDirectiveShorthand.png)
      So you could make structural directives without the '*' shorthands but they're annoying to write.
      Example:
      <div
        *ngFor="let hero of heroes; let i=index; let odd=odd; trackBy: trackById"
        [class.odd]="odd">
        ({{i}}) {{hero.name}}
      </div>

      turns into:

      <ng-template ngFor let-hero [ngForOf]="heroes"
        let-i="index" let-odd="odd" [ngForTrackBy]="trackById">
        <div [class.odd]="odd">
          ({{i}}) {{hero.name}}
        </div>
      </ng-template>

      also keep in mind, one structural directive per element.
