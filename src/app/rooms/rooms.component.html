[RoomsComponent]
<!--Example of Interpolation.
    There's a variable in the rooms.component.ts file
    which gets represented here with this syntax:-->
<h1>Welcome to {{hotelName}}</h1>
[HeaderComponent]
<app-header></app-header>
[end HeaderComponent]
<div [hidden]="hideRooms">
  <p>Number of rooms:</p>
  <!--Example of property binding syntax (remember the square brackets).
  property binding works with any valid html tag-->
  <!--Also example of ngStyle. You can use logic/pass variables.-->
  <!--Also example of *ngIf directive. Notice the `*` denoting that it's a structural directive-->
  <div
    *ngIf="rooms.availableRooms > 0"
    [ngStyle]="{'color': rooms.availableRooms > 0 ? 'green' : 'red'}"
    [innerText]="numberOfRooms"></div>
</div>

<!--
    Difference between interpolation and property binding?
    Property binding actually changes the dom and keeps data types,
    while interpolation always results in strings in the html.
-->

<!--****************************************************************************-->

<!--Example of event binding. Notice the parentheses in `(click)`-->
<button (click)="toggle()">toggle</button>

<!--Example of using another component within a component (app-rooms-list within app-rooms)
    Notice that we're using component communication (with the @Input decorator in app-rooms-list)
    @Input rooms in app-rooms-list is getting its array from roomList in app-rooms.
    -->
<div *ngIf="selectedRoom">You have selected: Room #{{selectedRoom.roomNumber}}</div>

<div>
  <button (click)="addRoom()">Add A Room</button>
</div>

<div *ngIf="rooms.totalRooms > 0">
  <app-rooms-list [rooms]="roomList" [title]="title" (roomSelected)="selectRoom($event)"></app-rooms-list>
</div>
