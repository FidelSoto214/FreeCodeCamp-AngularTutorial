  index.html - the very first file that is loaded, as per usual.
  When application is opened, initially index.html start to render
   and it will render with empty <app-root></app-root> - because Angular
   app is still to be loaded (you can test that easily with CRTL + U - that is
   initial content that browser see). That was the big bottleneck for the SEO of SPA apps.

  Once the Angular app is loaded, it will dynamically populate the
    content to the <app-root></app-root> of the index.html.

  Why is an error not thrown when index.html comes to <app-root></app-root> tag?
   Reason is, index.html is not an Angular template file, it is pure html,
   you can place any element inside it and it will never throw an error.
   But for Angular template files, during compile time it checks if is defined or
   not and throws compile time error if not defined.
